    "## Bayesian Denoising Approaches for Grayscale Images\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a grayscale image that is affected by two types of noise: additive Gaussian noise and multiplicative Gaussian noise (also known as speckle noise). Your task is to apply image processing techniques to denoise the image in two different ways for each type of noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method.\n",
    "2. Using the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) method with Total Variation (TV) regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the additive Gaussian noise scenario, the noise is modeled as $N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the noise. This noise is additive, meaning it is added to the original image pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the multiplicative Gaussian noise, the noise model is $1 + N$, where $N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ represents the noise that is multiplied by the original image pixel values, effectively modulating the brightness of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks to be completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Noise Addition:\n",
    "    - Add additive Gaussian noise to a clean grayscale image with a known $\\sigma$.\n",
    "    - Add multiplicative Gaussian noise to the same image with the same $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Denoising Implementations:\n",
    "    - Implement a function for MLE denoising for the additive Gaussian noise.\n",
    "    - Implement a function for MAP denoising using TV regularization for the additive Gaussian noise.\n",
    "    - Implement a function for MLE denoising for the multiplicative Gaussian noise.\n",
    "    - Implement a function for MAP denoising using TV regularization for the multiplicative Gaussian noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Denoising:\n",
    "    - Apply the respective denoising functions to the noisy images.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance Evaluation:\n",
    "    - Calculate and display the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for each denoised image, comparing against the original clean image.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Visualization:\n",
    "    - Display the original noisy images and their denoised counterparts in a figure with multiple subplots for easy comparison. Label each subplot with the corresponding noise and denoising technique used.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Analysis:\n",
    "    - Analyze the effectiveness of each denoising technique on both types of noise based on the computed PSNR and SSIM values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLE approach seeks to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, which measures how likely it is to observe the given data. In the case of image denoising, the \"parameters\" we want to estimate are the pixel values of the clean image. For additive Gaussian noise, if the noise \n",
    "$N$ is normally distributed, the likelihood of observing the noisy image $y$ given a clean image $x$ is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y_i | x_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y_i - x_i)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(y | x) = \\prod_{i} P(y_i | x_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "MAP estimation incorporates prior knowledge about the distribution of the parameters through Bayes' theorem. In the context of image denoising, a common prior is the Total Variation (TV) prior, which assumes that the clean image has a piecewise smooth structure. Baye's theorem states that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(x|y) = \\frac{P(y|x)P(x)}{P(y)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where\n",
    "- $P(x|y)$ is the posterior probability of the clean image given the noisy image.\n",
    "- $P(y∣x)$ is the likelihood of the noisy image given the clean image.\n",
    "- $P(x)$ is the prior probability of the clean image.\n",
    "- $P(y)$ is the marginal likelihood of the noisy image.\n",
    "\n",
    "For MAP estimation, we aim to maximize the posterior probability $P(x∣y)$. Since $P(y)$ is constant with respect to $x$, we can ignore it, and the MAP estimate is the one that maximizes $P(y∣x)P(x)$. With the TV prior, the MAP estimation involves an optimization problem that maximizes the log-posterior:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log P(x∣y)=\\log P(y∣x)+\\log P(x)−\\log P(y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The term $\\log P(x)$ can be designed to penalize the total variation in the image, encouraging smoothness between pixel values:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log P(x) \\propto −TV(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus, the MAP-TV estimation leads to solving:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x} = \\arg\\max_x \\left( \\log P(y | x) - \\lambda \\text{TV}(x) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between the likelihood term and the smoothness prior."
